This is a project I completed for my RLG 110 class. We are assigned a creative project as our final. I chose to make a simple chatbot that educates people about the beliefs
and practices, demographic information, and social and political views of various popular religions in the United States. I chose to create this chatbot because of my passion
for Computer Science and the issue of religious literacy in the United States. I think it is incredibly important to understand the role religion plays in the lives of Americans
and people worldwide. Peoples' religious beliefs (or lackthereof) have tremendous influence over their social and political views. Without understaning one's religious beliefs
you cannot understand them. This chatbot aims to help educate on various religious beliefs so that we may better understand and appreciate eachother. Religious literacy is just
one step in the long road to building compassion and respect between different cultures, religious groups, and individuals in the United States and across the world.
